\title{Paired samples t-test}
\usage{
pairedT(DV, IDV, Within, Parametric = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{DV}{A vector with the dependent variable}

\item{IDV}{A vector with the independent variable}

\item{Within}{The identity of the cases / The identity of the within factor}

\item{Parametric}{If FALSE the test is Wilcoxon Signed Rank test}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:

Descriptive_statistics: Descriptive statistics with the Mean, standard deviation, Median and N

Model_summary: Model's summary

Effect_size: Cohen's d effect size (if the model is significant and parametric)

Figure
}
\description{
The function conducts paired sample t-test. The data set should be with exact n observations per ID, otherwise the figure's and descriptive statistics' results will be inaccurate.
Based on stats::t.test()

\examples{
pairedT(DV = simulateData$Score, IDV = simulateData$Gender, Within = simulateData$ID)
