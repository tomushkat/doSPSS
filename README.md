# doSPSS
The goal of the package is to simplify and shorten procedures and code for statistical tests. Most of the functions contain frequentists inferential statistics tests, together with the preliminary tests and the relevant corrections. Moreover, the functions return the descriptive statistics, effect size, post hoc test, and a complex figure. The other functions support the test functions, as removing outliers.
