# doSPSS
The goal of the package is to simplify inferential statistics procedures.  Most of the functions contain inferential statistics tests automatically with the preliminary tests and the relevant corrections. Moreover, the functions return the descriptive statistics, effect size, post hoc test, and complex figure. The other functions support the test functions, as removing outliers.
